I have learned that Git is a useful version control tool that helps you track changes in your code, work on different versions at the same time, and keep a record of your projectâ€™s progress. GitHub, on the other hand, is an online platform where you can store your Git repositories, share code with others, and collaborate easily. Together, Git and GitHub make it easier to organize, maintain, and manage projects with a team.
