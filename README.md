I have learned that Git is a useful version control tool that helps you track changes in your code, work on different versions at the same time, and keep a record of your projectâ€™s progress. GitHub, on the other hand, is an online platform where you can store your Git repositories, share code with others, manage pull requests, and use tools like issue tracking and automation. Together, Git and GitHub make it easier to collaborate, stay organized, and maintain projects, especially when working with a team.
